<h4>Honorable Willis W. Berry Jr.</h4>

<p><strong>Party Affiliation:</strong> Democrat <br />
<strong>County:</strong> Philadelphia County <br />
<strong>Rating:</strong> <em>Not Recommended</em>; The Candidate has served as a judge on the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County since 1996. He has extensive experience in the Criminal Division. Prior to being elected to the bench, the Candidate practiced law in Philadelphia, focusing on criminal law. The Commission believes that while the Candidate has served well in Common Pleas Court, it cannot recommend him for election to the Supreme Court. This conclusion is based on the Candidate's lack of experience in areas of the law outside of criminal law, lack of administrative experience and lack of demonstrated community service. Further, he has not participated in bar-related functions, teaching, writing or his court's efforts to improve the justice system. For these reasons, the Commission has not recommended the Candidate for the Supreme Court.</p>
